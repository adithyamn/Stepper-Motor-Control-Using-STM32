# Stepper-Motor-Control-Using-STM32
In this mini project we are interfacing Stepper Motor with STM32F103C8 (Blue pill) board. . Stepper motor is brushless DC motor, Here we use a 32 step sequence. The motor rotates depending on the input we have given in the serial monitor. An ft232 usb serial connector has been used to flash the bootloader. And a ULN2003 motor driver  was used to drive the stepper motor.
